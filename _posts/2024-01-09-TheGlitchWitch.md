In the first half of 2024, I joined Glitch Witch team as a Gameplay Engineer, where "The Glitch Witch" is an Advanced Games Project at USC, inspired by games like Stardew Valley and wire circuit puzzle game, and developed using Unreal Engine 5.

Since joined the project in the middle, I didn't touch on the core mechnism's implementation. What I contributed are setting up background music and settings menu, creating the game start cutscene, and brainstorming ideas for the control tutorial implementation.
