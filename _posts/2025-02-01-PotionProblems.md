[Potion Problems](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3306050/Potion_Problems/) is MFA/AGP from USC, a 2D online multiplayer social deduction party game. Players will work together as wizards to craft potions while trying to uncover mischievous troublemakers within the group. Itâ€™s a very lighthearted social deduction game, taking inspiration from games such as Among Us, Club Penguin, Wizard 101, and a variety of social deduction tabletop games.

Currently, as part of the usability team, I create RITE schedules, conduct weekly playtests, analyze results, identify usability issues, update usability problems to the RITE task sheet, and work closely with design, QA, and engineering teams to ensure the best possible player experience.
