Potion Problems is MFA/AGP from USC, a 2D online multiplayer social deduction party game. Players will work together as wizards to craft potions while trying to uncover mischievous troublemakers within the group. Itâ€™s a very lighthearted social deduction game, taking inspiration from games such as Among Us, Club Penguin, Wizard 101, and a variety of social deduction tabletop games.

Currently, as part of the USC Advanced Games Project Potion Problem, I am involved in creating RITE schedules, conducting weekly playtests, analyzing results, and working closely with design, QA, and engineering teams to ensure the best possible player experience.
