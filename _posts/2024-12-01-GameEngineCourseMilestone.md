The objective of Game Engine Development Course(CSCI522) at USC is to design, develop and extend a 3D Game Engine in native C++. The development environment in
classes is set up as close to a game studio as instructor could.
Assignments are to develop some basic game engine features such as bounding volume and culling, physics, and so on.
Milestone topic is chose from various game engine features such as VFX, AI, audio, etc. 
The topic I chose is AI traversal behaviour: Add animated traversal behaviors, jumping over cover, taking cover, low cover/high cover. Create different kinds of waypoints hwere soldier can sync location and play animation. For example waypoint for low cover should be able to specify location where soldier should start playing animtion.
