Hi! I'm Qingzhi You, a game developer focused on gameplay engineering and game design. Although my background is more of a programmer, I'm advancing my game design skills.

Although I have played many games including most of the games' genres, my current favorite game types are role-playing games and action/fighting games. RPG allows players to experience and enjoy things and stories that they might never have in real life. More importantly, the unique interactions that games have, such as decision influence ending, create a more immersive experience than any other media can have.

Outside games, I like to read internet novels for interesting stories. I also enjoy exercise such as hitting a gym or swimming, which might be the reason why I like action games. Also, I'm self-learning piano. I never thought to be professional, only for several songs I am fond of.
