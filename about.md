Hi! I'm Qingzhi You, a game developer with a focus on gameplay engineering and game design. While my background leans more toward programming, I am actively advancing my skills in game design.

I have played a wide variety of games spanning most genres, and my current favorites are role-playing games (RPGs) and action/fighting games. RPGs allow players to experience and enjoy stories and scenarios that might be impossible in real life. More importantly, the unique interactive elements of games—such as decisions influencing endings—create a level of immersion unmatched by any other medium.

Outside of gaming, I enjoy reading internet novels for their intriguing stories. I also like exercising, such as going to the gym or swimming, which might explain my fondness for action games. Additionally, I am teaching myself piano—not to become a professional, but simply to play a few songs I love.
